# Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning 15 Days Learning Journey

This repository documents my learnings from the **Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning** course by **VLSI System Design (VSD)**. Over 15 days, I will explore key concepts, methodologies, and tools used in SoC design, documenting my progress and insights here.

## *Course Details*
- **Program:** NASSCOM-VSD Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning  
- **Duration:** 2 Weeks (15 Days)

### **SKY_L2 - Introduction to RISC-V**
### *What is RISC-V?*
RISC-V is an **open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** that follows the **Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC)** principles. It provides a simple and flexible instruction set, making it widely used for hardware design and implementation.

### *How RISC-V Code is Converted for Hardware*
In software compilation, a **C program** is converted into **assembly language** and then into **machine code** for execution. Similarly, in hardware design:

1. **RISC-V C code** is written for the desired functionality.
2. It is compiled and translated into **HDL (Hardware Description Language)**.
3. HDL is the interface for the RISC-V to Layout process.
4. The HDL design undergoes **synthesis, placement, and routing (PnR)** to generate the final layout.
5. This layout is used for **fabricating the physical chip**.

This process enables the direct implementation of RISC-V-based designs into **hardware chips**, optimizing performance and power efficiency.

### *RISC-V Flow Overview*
RTL implements the RISC-V specification and then RTL to layout(standard RTL to GDS flow)
Below is a representation of how RISC-V code transforms into a physical layout:

### **SKY_L3 - From Software Applications to Hardware**

### *How Software Translates into Hardware*
When we run an application, it undergoes multiple stages before reaching the hardware. The process follows this hierarchy:

1. **Application Software** → Executed by users (ex: MS Office, excel, etc).
2. **System Software** → Converts the application into machine-executable format(assembly language).
3. **Hardware** → Executes the binary instructions and performs the desired operations.

### *Major Components of System Software*
#### **1. Operating System (OS)**
- Handles **I/O operations, memory allocation, and low-level system functions**.
- Acts as a bridge between the user and hardware.

#### **2. Compiler**
- Takes the **application program from the OS** and converts it into **instructions**.
- Generates a **.exe (executable) file** that contains machine-level instructions.
- The syntax of instructions depends on the **hardware architecture** (e.g., x86, ARM, RISC-V).

#### **3. Assembler**
- Converts the compiler's instructions into **assembly language (machine code)**.
- This **binary format** is understandable by the **hardware** and can be executed directly.

### *Software-to-Hardware Flow*
The diagram below illustrates the **entire flow from application software to hardware**:

### **Example: Stopwatch Application**
Let’s take the **Stopwatch App** as an example. The process follows these steps:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc2e1e4d-d3a0-47a1-a250-e68e70b9403e)

1. The **C code** of the stopwatch app is written.
2. The **compiler** translates it into **RISC-V assembly instructions**.
3. The **assembler** converts these instructions into **machine language** (binary).
4. The **hardware executes** the binary and the stopwatch behaves as programmed.

### **Abstract Interface: Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**
Instructions act as an **abstract interface** between **software and hardware**. This interface is known as the **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**. 

- In our case, we focus on **RISC-V ISA**.
- Instructions are converted into **RTL (Register Transfer Level) code**.
- The RTL is synthesized into a **netlist**, which is used for **physical design**.

#### **RTL to Physical Design Flow**
1. **RISC-V Instructions → RTL Snippet (Hardware Description)**
2. **RTL → Synthesized Netlist**
3. **Netlist → Physical Design (Placement & Routing)**
4. **Final layout → Fabrication**

Below is the **flow from RTL to the final physical design**:

## **SKY130_D1_SK2 - SoC Design and OpenLANE**

### **SKY_L1 - Introduction to All Components of Open-Source Digital ASIC Design**

### *What is Digital ASIC Design?*
An **Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)** is a chip designed for a specific function. The key components required for digital ASIC design are:

- **RTL IPs** – Pre-designed intellectual property blocks (e.g., processors, memory).
- **EDA Tools** – Software or CAD tools for design, verification, and implementation.
- **PDK Data** – Process Design Kit, containing foundry-specific design rules and libraries.

#### **1. RTL IPs (Register Transfer Level Intellectual Property)**
RTL defines the hardware behavior using **HDL (Hardware Description Language)**. Open-source RTL resources include:
- [LibreCores](https://www.librecores.org/)
- [OpenCores](https://www.opencores.org/)
- [GitHub](https://www.github.com/)

#### **2. EDA Tools (Electronic Design Automation)**
EDA tools are used for designing, simulating, and verifying ASICs. Some key open-source tools:
- **Qflow** – Complete RTL to GDSII flow.
- **OpenROAD** – Automated RTL to GDS flow.
- **OpenLane** – Open-source ASIC design flow.
- **SPICE Simulator** – Circuit simulation tool.
- **Magic** – Layout editor.

#### **3. PDK (Process Design Kit)**
##### **What is a PDK?**
A **Process Design Kit (PDK)** serves as the **interface between the foundry and designers**, providing essential data for ASIC fabrication.

A PDK includes:
- **Process Design Rules** – **DRC (Design Rule Check), LVS (Layout vs. Schematic), PEX (Parasitic Extraction)**
- **Device Models** – Defines transistor behavior.
- **Digital Standard Cell Libraries** – Includes **NAND, NOR, Flip-flops, etc.**
- **I/O Libraries** – Interfaces for external connections.

##### *SkyWater 130nm Open-Source PDK*
On **June 30, 2020**, **Google** released the **SkyWater 130nm Open-Source PDK**, making it the **first FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software) 130nm production PDK**.

### **ASIC Flow Objective: RTL to GDSII**
The main goal of the ASIC design process is to convert **RTL (Register Transfer Level) code** into **GDSII format**, which is used for fabrication.

This process is also known as:
- **Automated Place-and-Route (PnR)**
- **Physical Implementation**
